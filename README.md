Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union, based in Luxembourg (LU). It publishes official, harmonized statistics on the European Union and the euro area, offering a comparable, reliable, and objective portrayal of Europe's society and economy.

A vast range of data is available for the EU as a whole, for Member States and in many cases also for candidate countries, EFTA members and other European countries, down to the level of regions and cities. All users may consult or download data and publications free of charge from the Eurostat web site. For more information on Eurostats policies and copyright rules:
