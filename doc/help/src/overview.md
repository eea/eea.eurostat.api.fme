# Eurostat (eea.Eurostat)
This FME Package contains the Eurostat Reader introduced for FME 2022.

Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union, based in Luxembourg (LU). It publishes official, harmonised statistics on the European Union and the euro area, offering a comparable, reliable and objective portrayal of Europe's society and economy.

A vast range of data is available for the EU as a whole, for Member States and in many cases also for candidate countries, EFTA members and other European countries, down to the level of regions and cities. All users may consult or download data and publications free of charge from the Eurostat web site.

## Usage

The Eurostat Reader checks which datasets (dataflows) are available. The reader will allow you to pick one dataset and will read this for you.

Optional filters can be set in the parameter options.

FME Feature Types are defined by the dataset chosen.
